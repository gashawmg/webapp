This Web App can predict the solubility of compounds in logS (mol/L or M).
It needs SMILES strings as input and calculates 2D molecular descriptors using [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/index.html) to predict solubility.
The output CSV file can be downloaded from the app.
This solubility prediction application can be accessed using this [link](https://share.streamlit.io/gashawmg/webapp/main/solubility.py) .
You can try it using SMILES of your favorite molecule.
